			<p>The thief is planning an escape using a teleportation wristband, but it needs time to charge. So the thief must cleverly evade the guards, until the teleporation is ready to use.</p><br />
			<p>	In this game, one person is designated as the thief, while the others are guards trying to catch the thief. The guards must catch the thief in a certain amount of time. If they fail to find the thief, they lose. But if they manage to locate the thief, they win. </p><br />
			<p>To help the guards find the thief, they use a map of the area on their smartphones that has the location of all other guards. However, the thief is a master hacker and is able to access the guard's map without their detection. The key to win is coordinating the right strategy to try and catch the thief, or find creative places to hide, and always stay on the move. </p><br />
			<p><strong>Save the Dub Diamond!</strong></p>
